         This service is designed for those that do not already have a resume. we will work with you by way of our detailed career development questionnaire and a short phone call if necessary, to understand all of your prior experiences, strengths, weaknesses, interests, volunteer experiences, major achievements, education, and career objectives to develop an industry specific custom resume designed to catch the attention of recruiters.

        <p>
          Our resume writers come with decades of experience and know what a ‘keeper’ resume looks like. not only will it be formatted professional and be visually appealing, but it will also contain the necessary keywords that both recruiters, and Applicant Tracking Systems will recognize as being a top quality candidate.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will also have one of our industry mentors review your resume and provide their comments to be incorporated into the final product. this ensures that your resume is ready to pass the “6 second” recruiter review test.
        <p>
        <p>
          Dont worry about all of the different formats that your employers will request, we have you all covered. you will receive a Word, PDF, text file all for the same price, no extra charges apply here like some of our competitors.

        <h4>For those ready to get mentored by someone who's where you want to be</h4>
        <p>
           This service is designed to provide you with an ‘inside’ mentor who will be either still in the job that you are looking to get into, or has recently left. we will set you up with a mentor who still remembers what it is like to go through the recruiting process and who remembers what they did to get the job offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mentors have all been screened and interviewed by our chief career development officer, and come with a wide range of experiences and backgrounds. they all have excelled in their careers and have lots of information to share with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will be able to communicate with your mentor in whatever way is easiest for the both of you. remember that our mentors are busy professionals, so you will have the opportunity to connect with your mentors over email, phone, and video chat communication channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will be presented with 3 mentors that match what your specifications to select from and once chosen, your mentorship relationship begins.
        </p>
        <p>
          They will be ready and excited to meet and work with you to achieve all of your goals.
          This mentor relationship will consist of six 20 minute time slots which can be used over a one year period. these 20 minute time slots are meant to be opportunities to ensure that previous goals have been met and work on setting new goals for the upcoming job search stages, as well as to provide mentees the chance to ask the mentors questions and receive truthful responses.
