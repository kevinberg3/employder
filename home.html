              <p class="aboutus">We founded Employder, on the belief that even after spending an incredible sum at University both in time and money, that we were not fully prepared for our careers. We were well educated but lacked the skills, knowledge and most importantly the experience that would allow us to hit the ground running. After several years, we looked back and noticed that there was a very poor infrastructure to assure students to the given career path that they had invested so greatly in. We saw mentoring being provided by people that were too far removed for knowing what it truly took to break into a new career. Yes, there were lots of resources available to try and figure out all the little secrets and events to meet people that were in the right roles, but these took an enormous amount of time and could often lead to no solution. Web sites and forums could be helpful, but often times had misleading information, or in some cases completely wrong information.

              <p class="aboutus">At Employder, our belief is to offer a fully catered mentorship and career service by top professionals who have just gone through what you're about to go through. They've worked in the multi-national companies, and top-tier firms and know what it takes. While we can't promise you a job, we can promise that we'll put you in the best situation possible to landing your dream job.

              <p class="aboutus">Employder is the support network to get your career started off on the right track. Our services include preparing you for a career and matching you with a mentor who's just done what you're about to go through.

              <p class="aboutus">
                Our goal is to hold your hand and lead you towards career planning and mentorship from people who have just gone through what you're about to and know what it's like to be in your shoes.  They've worked in recruiting and excelled in their career and now they can help share their experience with you.
